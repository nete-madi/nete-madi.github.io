nete-madi.github.io: My personal website
=========================

This website is built using a Jekyll theme, based on the [Freelancer bootstrap theme ](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/)

This theme is a modification of Jerome Lachaud's version of the Freelancer bootstrap theme, which can be [found here: ](https://github.com/jeromelachaud/freelancer-theme). I have duplicated my fork of the theme into this repository; you can find the fork [here.](https://github.com/nete-madi/personal-site-fork)
